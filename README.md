Animated Portfolio
Welcome to my beautifully animated portfolio, built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS. This project showcases my skills, projects, and professional journey through an engaging, modern, and fully responsive design. It leverages a variety of cutting-edge technologies to create smooth animations and an intuitive user experience.

Interactive Animations: Powered by Framer Motion and tailwindcss-animate, the portfolio provides smooth, eye-catching animations that bring the content to life.
Material UI Integration: Clean and modern components styled with MUI/Material provide a consistent and professional look.
Radix UI Avatars: Profile avatars are implemented using Radix UI, adding a polished touch to the overall design.
Customization with Tailwind CSS: The project takes full advantage of Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and customization, making it easy to adjust and extend.
Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
MUI/Material: Provides ready-to-use React components with a modern design.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
